            <h3>General Questions</h3>
            <div>
                <h4>Are there any necessary qualifications?</h4>
                <p>No! If you have done some hobby coding in your spare time that might help you find your feet quicker
                    but it definitely isn't necessary.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>How long is the course?</h4>
                <p>The course consists of 12 weeks of training, followed by an 18-month job placement in industry with
                    the option of making that a permanent role.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Do you need any previous coding experience?</h4>
                <p>No! No previous experience is required. We will provide all the training you need to become a
                    confident software developer. However, upon application we will provide you with pre-reading which
                    will enable you to take the technical tests we set. Please give yourself time to study this before
                    taking the tests.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>I'm currently studying, can I take this bootcamp at the same time?</h4>
                <p>The course and placement are both full-time so you would be unable to study alongside taking our
                    bootcamp and working during the placement. If you are taking evening classes then you might be able
                    to do these alongside the placement, as with any job, but the 12-week course is intensive and
                    requires
                    a lot of study in your spare time so we wouldn't recommend taking classes alongside it.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Course Details</h3>
            <div>
                <h4>What are the hours and where is it?</h4>
                <p> The course is full-time Monday-Friday. The initial 12-week bootcamp is based in
                    our offices in north London. Teaching hours are between 10am-4pm but we ask learners to do at least
                    2 hours of individual study outside of these hours to make sure they complete the course
                    successfully.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>What languages/technology do you teach?</h4>
                <p>This varies from course to course depending on the companies we are working at the time.
                    Our current cohort are studying Java followed by React but throughout the course we introduce our
                    learners
                    to a wide variety of languages and aim to make them good full-stack developers, not specialists in a
                    particular technology. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>How much is the course?</h4>
                <p>The course deposit is £500. However, we refund this to you in full upon completing the course. We also
                    have means-tested bursaries available.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>What is the course structure?</h4>
                <p>The first three weeks will be spent on a bootcamp going through a series of exercises which increase
                    in difficulty as you go along.
                    Following this we will introduce you to another technology and start working on mini-projects.
                    For the final four weeks you will complete a group project.
                    Throughout the course there will also be training in Agile practices, soft skills and interview
                    techniques.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>What size are the cohorts?</h4>
                <p>Cohorts range in size between 5-10 learners. We keep them small to make sure you get enough
                    one-to-one time with the trainer.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Placements</h3>
            <div>
                <h4>Do I get a say in where my placement is?</h4>
                <p>Yes! We won't force you to take a placement you don't want but this is also why we can't guarantee
                    that we find you a job as it is up to you to interview at for the placement and accept the role.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Will I be paid a salary?</h4>
                <p>Not during the 12 week training, but once you have successfully completed that we will pay you a
                    £30,000 salary.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Will the placement be based in London?</h4>
                <p>The vast majority of our placements are based in London but on the off-chance they are based
                    elsewhere we will offer a relocation package.</p>
